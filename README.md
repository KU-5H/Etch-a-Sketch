# Etch-a-Sketch
A front-end sketchpad made using HTML/CSS/Javascript to let users draw on a customizable 16x16 grid with different colors and styles. Uses a core understanding of DOM manipulation skills.

Inspired from the Odin Project's <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch">Etch-a-Sketch</a> idea.
